                    GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

 The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
 cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

 IMPORTANT NOTICE: This software includes proprietary algorithms and
 methodologies that are solely owned by the creators. While the general
 framework is available under AGPL, the following components are EXCLUDED
 from public license and remain proprietary:

 1. The emotional context analysis algorithms in emotionalContextService.js
 2. The memory enhancement algorithms in memoryEnhancedService.js
 3. Any configurations, weights, and parameters related to memory processing

 To use these proprietary components for commercial purposes, you must
 obtain a separate commercial license from the copyright holders.

 The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
 our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users.

 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

 Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
 with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
 you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
 and/or modify the software.

 A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
 improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
 receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
 incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and
 encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of
 software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
 The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
 letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
 source code to the public.
